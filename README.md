# Some variants of the 1D Riemann problem

The Riemann problem is an IVP with a discontinuity in the domain. The Riemmann test problems usually lead to non-linear shock waves, rarefaction waves and linear contact waves when solved by non-linear hyperbolic equations. So they provide a good test for validating shock capturing schemes. Some examples are provided in this repository.
